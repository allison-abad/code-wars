## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

For these practice problems I focus entirely on Javascript to solve the questions being asked. 


## Lessons Learned:
Everyday stimulating my mind to become a better developer by coding and reviewing my code and from other software engineers. There are multiple ways of solving aan algorithmic question, it's important to maintain patience and always make sure you understand the question to properly answer it. Don't rush into answering the code problem, but instead reread problem and disect it.
