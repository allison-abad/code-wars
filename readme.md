# code-wars
This folder contains the daily code war practice problems  I have worked on, .


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

For these practice problems I focus entirely on Javascript to solve the questions being asked. I incorporate Pseudo code as well to help and refer back to my process of solving the code war and to also help me better understand what I had written out.

## Lessons Learned:
The fact that there are multiple ways of solving a code war, it's important to maintain patience and always make sure you understand the question to properly answer it. Don't rush into answering the code problem, but instead read it again and break it down. With best practice you can solve without having multiple errors.
